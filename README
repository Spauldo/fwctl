fwctl - A simple firewall control system

This set of programs is designed to activate or deactivate an anchor on an
OpenBSD firewall.  The client should be run under a system that supports
wxWidget's wxTaskBarIcon (this would be things like Windows' systray or KDE's
SystemTray).  wxWidgets and Python 2.7 are required for the client.  The server
only requires OpenBSD.

This can use IPv4 or IPv6, or both, depending on the -a flag.

The fwkids executable requires SUID root.  See 'Caveats' for more information.


Server Installation:
--------------------

There is no "install" target for make.  You have to install manually.

Decompress the archive.

Edit the fwctl.rc file and change the IP address in "daemon_flags" to the
IP address you want fwctl to listen on.  This should be your INTERNAL address.
Running this on your external address would allow anyone on the internet to
play with your firewall.  (It might be a good idea to block this port explicitly
and only allow the controlling machines access.)  Save the file.

Edit the file fwkids.c and change the filename read by pfctl.  This will be
near the top, in this line:

  char *cmd_fwup[]   = {"pfctl", "-a", "kids", "-f",
			      "/etc/pf.anchor.kids-blocked", NULL};

(the filename is "/etc/pf.anchor.kids-blocked")

Save the file and enter the following commands:
  cd <archive_name>
  make

(as root:)
  cp fwctl.rc /etc/rc.d/fwctl
  cp fwctl /usr/local/sbin
  cp fwkids /usr/local/sbin
  chown root:wheel /etc/rc.d/fwctl
  chown root:wheel /usr/local/sbin/fwctl
  chown root:wheel /usr/local/sbin/fwkids
  chmod 555 /etc/rc.d/fwctl
  chmod 755 /usr/local/sbin/fwctl
  chmod 4755 /usr/local/sbin/fwkids

Edit your /etc/rc.conf.local and add something like this:

  fwctl_flags="-a 192.168.0.1"

You can us a name or an address for the -a flag, but it must point to the
internal IP address of your firewall.  If you use a name instead of an address,
and that name maps to more than one address, fwctl will listen to all of them.
This is useful if you want both IPv4 and IPv6 clients.

Now, you need firewall rules.  I won't go into detail - pf is a complicated
subject better explained elsewhere.  They key point is that you want to put the
commands you want to toggle in an anchor (a self-contained script the main
script can refer to).  The anchor rules must be in a file (the sort pfctl can
reference with -f).  Bringing the firewall "up" will set the anchor rules to
those in the file; bringing "down" the firewall will flush the rules, leaving
the anchor empty.

OpenBSD's pf FAQ has a section on anchors.


Client Installation:
--------------------

First, install Python and wxWidgets.  Then place the python script somewhere and
set it to autostart.  Two flags can be passed to the program; -s for the
server's address or name, and -p for the port number.  You can omit the port
number if using the default port.

That's about as exact as I can get, since each system is different.


Use:
----

When the client is running, an icon will represent the current state of the
firewall.  Hovering over the icon will bring up a tooltip that gives a text
representation of the current state.  Activating the icon (by, say,
right-clicking on Windows, for instance) will bring up a menu where the state
can be changed.

There may be a short lag between the time the user sends the command and the
time the icon changes.  This is normal, if for whatever reason there is a lag
in the network code.


Protocol Details:
-----------------

The client-server protocol is a very simple, request-response system.  The
client sends a command as a UDP packet containing three characters, and the
server responds with a UDP packet also containing three characters.

Commands and Responses are as follows:

Command | Meaning                   | Response | Meaning
--------+---------------------------+----------+-------------------------------
  FST   | Report firewall status    | FUP      | Anchor rules are in place
        |                           | FDN      | Anchor rules are empty
	|                           | ERR      | An error has occurred
  FUP   | Bring up the anchor       | ACK      | Anchor rules have been added
        |                           | ERR      | An error has occurred
  FDN   | Take down the anchor      | ACK      | Anchor rules have been flushed
        |                           | ERR      | An error has occurred

If any other command is sent, the server will respond with NAK.


Caveats:
--------

This is special purpose software, not a general purpose tool.  I've written it
for my own use.  I make this code available for others who wish to do something
similar, but I have little interest in expanding its utility.  A full-on
firewall control system should have authentication, for one - as it stands,
anyone who can throw three characters into a UDP packet and send it to a socket
on the firewall can bring the anchor up and down at will.

I use it to control if one computer, a smart TV, and a game console have access
to the internet.  The kids get grounded a lot, and I'm not always around to
ssh in and do it manually.

Note that I only flush the rules, not active connections.  This means that any
connections already in progress will still go through.  If that is an issue for
you, you'll need to edit pfkids.c and change the call to pf from "-F rules" to
"-F all".  I haven't tested that, so if you do, drop me a line and let me know
if it works.

The fwkids executable required SUID root because it runs pfctl directly.  This
is a bit awkward, since that means there are two executables instead of just
the one.  I could have put it all in one binary, but that would have meant
having a network listener running as root, and I'm not confident enough in my
C skills to risk that.  I have tried to keep the bare minimum necessary in
fwkids.c to minimize the risk of exploits.  If the firewall machine is
multiuser (WHY?), it would be best to set the permissions to 4750 and assign
the group to match the group fwctl runs as.

At the time of this writing, wxWidgets does not have full support for Python 3.
This is why I use Python 2.7.


TODO:
-----

The install process should be automated.

I should probably add some signal handlers in here.

Rewrite it all in LISP. (just kidding)
